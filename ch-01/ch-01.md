# CH-01: Hello World and more..

## A simple rust program
If you go to file hello_world.rs you'll find the below program:
```
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
}
```
The main function is the entry point of a rust program. 

1. The reference to the vector that the for loop holds prevents simultaneous modification of the whole vector.

2. The reason weâ€™re able to use &s2 in the call to add is that the compiler can coerce the &String argument into a &str. When we call the add method, Rust uses a deref coercion, which here turns &s2 into &s2[..]
```
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
    let s2 = String::from("world!");
    let s3 = s1 + &s2;
```
